# Twitter sentiment analysis
In this paper, I compare
the sequential and distributed version of the Twitter
sentiment analysis. <br />
The entire code is written in Java using Maven. <br />
The file .jar in the project folder is used in Amazon EMR to perform the distributed version.
The data set is downloaded from http://thinknook.com/twitter-sentiment-analysis-training-corpus-dataset-2012-09-22/
